# Jr-Design-Sample-Project

For the class Engineering Design I, also known as junior design, our class was split into teams and
assigned the task of loading and delivering boxes of keychains.

I served as the electrical systems engineering lead for team 5. I wrote a reflection at the end of that
semester detailing which components I was responsible for, why they were selected, and what I learned
from each part of the process of integrating that component into our system. That file is attached
below. This is a deep reflection, so please use the table of contents to find the part(s) you are most
interested in reading about.

Thank you for your careful consideration.
